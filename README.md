# ABC Opticals

I developed this project as part of my assignment for my Diploma in Information Technology at TAFE.

This is a brochure style website (single page website)

The website has been designed to be responsive in mobile, tablet, desktop and large screens using `flex` and `media queries`. 

It is `WCAG 2.1 Level-AA` compliant to ensure accessibility across all user base.

Only semantic elements have been the styles target specific elements without the use of classes and ids.

The website is hosted on github pages.
